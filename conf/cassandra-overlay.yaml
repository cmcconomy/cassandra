# The overlay accepts any configuration settings that you would normally find
# in cassandra.yaml
#
# The purpose of the overlay is to allow you to maintain a "standard" config
# which is distributed to all new nodes, allowing you to only keep the
# configuration settings that vary from server-to-server in this file.
#
# A common example is when you have to specify ips to bind to, eg:
# listen_address: localhost
# rpc_address: localhost
#
# refer to documentation in cassandra.yaml for more details on particular
# settings.
